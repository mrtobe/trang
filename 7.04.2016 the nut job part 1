The nut job
When you're an animal,life's a balancing act
Each day is a quest to find food to servive
It's a tough nut to crack
Wait, you think I'm one of these dopey pigeons?
No, no, no, no, this is me. The handsome one
I got no problem with my feathered friends
In fact, I get a real kick outta them
They're really soft on the feet
And they're always building these littke picnic baskets that offer the accasional treat
Apparently, not today
Thanks for nothing
At the end of the day. I'm just like all you fine people
I am not hero
Im Just a squirrel tryping to get a nut
one bag of nuts, please
And that's my buddy named, well , Buddy
He don't talk much
yeah, they say the world's there for the taking
So that's just what we're gonna do
Come along. Please keep that food coming, everyone
That's it. All finds are valuable
Mole, what is our food level now?
Pickings are slim this year
I'm sure we could rephrase
We're at starvation levels!
We'e gonna die
Now, now, now, have optimism, brethren
Stiff upper lip, everyone
Ah, here we are, food
I'm afraid this is the wrong kind of nut. Hmm
Shiny
What's that? A nut cart?
A nut cart?
A nut cart? my eyes!
This could be our salvation for winter
Anddie
I'm on my way. You won't reget this
uh uh uh. Grayson is going with you
With all due respect, sir, I can do this on my own. I don't
Grayson
Chick dig the tail
Help Anddie retrieve as many nuts from that cart as possible
For the park
Oh, what she said
And above all, keep a wary watchful eye out for you know who
No, not him
yes, him
Ho ho ho, come to daddy
Hey mack, you know where the Oakton Bank is?
Oh, thanks
Where'd you learn to drive?
Hey, mister!
I want some nuts
Scram,kid,we're closed
The sign says you're open!
Burn rubber
Did you here me? I want nuts!
We got to get those nuts before the rest of the park gets in on this
Let's go over the plan
That's us, there's the cart
We rob the cart and then stuff ourselves silly all winter
What are you looking at?
Great. We got company
ok, we got to move
get in the pail
officer, that man, he assaulted me with nuts
It was horrible
Now listen, officer, that is not...
I need to see your vendor permits
there it is
enough food to feed the park for the entire winter
Thai dog will make it difficult, though
Grayson
Grayson
quite
what are you doing?
i'm smelling for any sign of that rascal. Surly Squirrel
Picking up rather strange scents, though
Cashews, man musk, dog hair
i knew it. you stay here
Honestly, woman. Iam still the park hero around here!
Which reminds me, why haven't you asked me out on a date?
I smell a rat
What are you doing here Surly
Do you like cashews? You want some cashews?
Who needs a permit when you got nuts?
So you're after this nut can too, huh?
of course i'm, the park needs it
Well, too late, sister. Amscray
Buddy and I got here first, and I ain't sharing
oh yes you are
Fall's half over and the park's having the worst shortage in years
That nut cart can feed everyone
Hey, we 'll work together. we can work out a deal
uh, pass me that metal thingy , will you
i just, i don't get it
you have all the drive and ability to help the park, but you never do
You know, this is a chance to prove Raccoon is wrong about you
I dont care what Raccoon thinks
Well, then do it for the park. Stop thinking about yourself all the time
Look, I'm independent and that means looking out for number one
I suggest you do the same if you want to survice
Got that?
I fell sorry for you, Surly
Found him, Andie! In a tree, no less
Very crafty, Surly
I shall now arrest you before with the park's nut cat caper
it's okay, Grayson. I got him
No Grayson, she doen't . You better help her
Well you, I'm gonna
Hey, Surger Ray, take the gloves off
I'm just gonna rip your tail off
Now, how about that date?
Listen, i'd love to keep chatting, but i got a date with destiny
Destiny, Do I know her?
Buena suerte, chumps
That was thrilling!
That was painful
This is going to end up bad
'Excuseme, officer
I happen to have seen the whole thing
This little girl might be exaggerating a little bit
I am not
Did you see that? you're my witness
Did you see that, Officer?
Yeah, yeah, she assaulted me, officer'
Aww, great
Bon appetit
Hey your cart, it's getting away
Holy Toledo!
Nuts
What a woman!
Did i save the day?
Grayson, try to get as much food for the stock as you can
Hey, what's that smell
That my cologne, made from tree sap and falcon tears
Get back. Hey, watch the tail
Flammable here, come on
These nuts are ours
These nuts are mine
Okay Surly, let's negotiate. We can share it with the park
Yeah, that sounds fair. How about 100 me, zero for you?
'They definitely don't have permit for that'
Whe have to stop this cart
Photo op!
Surly, come help me, man
What? Curse you, Surly
Surly you coward
Heck of a day
Grayson, the oak tree
The tally is in
The food collected in the truck of our oak tree
will not be enough to carry us through winter
I knew it. We're gonna die!
Settle down, settle down now, please. Raccoon!
Raccoon is giving a speech
Though this outlook appears disheartening...
Excuseme, Andie and Grayson are on...with determination and hoonor
This park will persevere!
Take heart, park brethren, there is hope!
Raccoon! Quiet
I'd like to take this moment to point out
Grayson's never let us down before
I belive he is on his way right at this very moment carrying...
Flaming can of nuts
What?
our food! It will be destroyed!
Why didn't you say anything?
Abandon tree! Abandon tree!
Not my perfectly symmetrical face! No!
Grayson, Grayson
Where are you?
What happened here?
Who is responsible for this?
Let go of me, you clowns!
You're making a big mistake here
I got an alibi! I got witnesses
found him hiding in one of our holes, just like a snake
I was recovering buried nuts, that's what i was doing
You guys smell, like, burnt nuts or something? That me?
What's going ...ahh!
Look at that!
You guys are messed for winter, man!
I mean, wow! Just look at that bonfire!
You didn't see that coming, did you?
Never fear! This sweet bod is undamaged!
Raccoon, let me oranize the trial. Just give the order
Another trial? He's never learned
He is a clear and present danger!
You...
No, no, we do things by the rule of law
Let justice take care of him
They want justice, Andie, and justice they will receive
All those in favor of banishment, raise your paws?
Banishment? Banishment?
Bandages? Yes, Please
Why are you hesitating?
He's refused to join us, ridiculed our hard work...stolen, cheated, lied,..and now destroyed our only food for winter
What say all?
and stick em up?
Why is the ground moving towards my face?
We don't convict without a trial. This isn't how we do things
I have run out of options for that squirrel, Andie
Do what you will, do what is right
Buddy has not voted, and it has to be unanimous, that's the rule
you won't vote against me, will you' old buddy?
You were saying?
