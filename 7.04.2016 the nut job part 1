The nut job
When you're an animal,life's a balancing act
Each day is a quest to find food to servive
It's a tough nut to crack
Wait, you think I'm one of these dopey pigeons?
No, no, no, no, this is me. The handsome one
I got no problem with my feathered friends
In fact, I get a real kick outta them
They're really soft on the feet
And they're always building these littke picnic baskets that offer the accasional treat
Apparently, not today
Thanks for nothing
At the end of the day. I'm just like all you fine people
I am not hero
Im Just a squirrel tryping to get a nut
one bag of nuts, please
And that's my buddy named, well , Buddy
He don't talk much
yeah, they say the world's there for the taking
So that's just what we're gonna do
Come along. Please keep that food coming, everyone
That's it. All finds are valuable
Mole, what is our food level now?
Pickings are slim this year
I'm sure we could rephrase
We're at starvation levels!
We'e gonna die
Now, now, now, have optimism, brethren
Stiff upper lip, everyone
Ah, here we are, food
I'm afraid this is the wrong kind of nut. Hmm
Shiny
What's that? A nut cart?
A nut cart?
A nut cart? my eyes!
This could be our salvation for winter
Anddie
I'm on my way. You won't reget this
uh uh uh. Grayson is going with you
With all due respect, sir, I can do this on my own. I don't
Grayson
Chick dig the tail
Help Anddie retrieve as many nuts from that cart as possible
For the park
Oh, what she said
And above all, keep a wary watchful eye out for you know who
No, not him
yes, him
Ho ho ho, come to daddy
Hey mack, you know where the Oakton Bank is?
Oh, thanks
Where'd you learn to drive?
Hey, mister!
I want some nuts
Scram,kid,we're closed
The sign says you're open!
Burn rubber
Did you here me? I want nuts!
We got to get those nuts before the rest of the park gets in on this
Let's go over the plan
That's us, there's the cart
We rob the cart and then stuff ourselves silly all winter
What are you looking at?
Great. We got company
ok, we got to move
get in the pail
officer, that man, he assaulted me with nuts
It was horrible
Now listen, officer, that is not...
I need to see your vendor permits
there it is
enough food to feed the park for the entire winter
Thai dog will make it difficult, though
Grayson
Grayson
quite
what are you doing?
i'm smelling for any sign of that rascal. Surly Squirrel
Picking up rather strange scents, though
Cashews, man musk, dog hair
i knew it. you stay here
Honestly, woman. Iam still the park hero around here!
Which reminds me, why haven't you asked me out on a date?
I smell a rat
What are you doing here Surly
Do you like cashews? You want some cashews?
Who needs a permit when you got nuts?
So you're after this nut can too, huh?
of course i'm, the park needs it
Well, too late, sister. Amscray
Buddy and I got here first, and I ain't sharing
oh yes you are
Fall's half over and the park's having the worst shortage in years
That nut cart can feed everyone
Hey, we 'll work together. we can work out a deal
uh, pass me that metal thingy , will you
i just, i don't get it
you have all the drive and ability to help the park, but you never do
You know, this is a chance to prove Raccoon is wrong about you
I dont care what Raccoon thinks
Well, then do it for the park. Stop thinking about yourself all the time
