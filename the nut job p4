Surly. They think I shaved their butts
Surly, careful, they come hither
What happened? You were up here
You ready for this piece of news
It was Mole
Saw him try to drown the twins
He confessed to everything
Mole?
It was all Raccoon’s idea
So you’re blaming Raccoon because he kicked you out of the park
No. I’m not
Raccoon has never harmed us before
But he sure has
Hey listen. I just wanna get my cut and split, allright
Grason. You were their
I was! Wait... where?
I think it was me, don’t you
No, no one said that
Just explain yourself
Buddy, did you see anything
Wait, you’re asking him
He can help you. You’re wasting your time
He’s useless! Can’t speak
Only knows how to take orders? Kinda like you
Is that how you treat the only anomal who defends you?
